# MAMMOCARE: AI-Powered Mammogram Guidance

MAMMOCARE is a web application designed to help patients understand mammogram results using AI, securely manage their reports, and connect with doctors for consultations.

## üöÄ Overview

This project provides:
* An AI tool (using YOLOv8) to analyze mammogram images and highlight potential areas of interest.
* Secure portals for different users: Guests, Patients, Doctors, and Administrators.
* Features for patients to save reports privately, download PDFs, and book/chat with doctors.
* Tools for doctors to manage patient requests, review shared reports, and conduct consultations via chat.
* An admin panel for user management, system configuration (like the AI server URL), and activity reporting.
* A privacy-first design using Firebase for secure data handling.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Guest Access:** Quick AI analysis preview without an account (no data saved).
* **Patient Portal:** Secure login, AI detection, private report saving & management, PDF downloads, doctor search/booking, secure chat with file sharing.
* **Doctor Portal:** Secure login, profile & availability management, booking request handling (accept/decline), secure chat with file sharing, private note-taking on reports.
* **Admin Portal:** Secure login, user management (view, create doctors, delete users), system settings configuration, activity report generation.
* **AI Detection:** Integrates with a separate Python backend running a YOLOv8 model trained on the MIAS dataset (see separate AI Training Report for model details).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS), JavaScript
* **Backend (Cloud Platform):**
    * Firebase Authentication (User Login/Signup)
    * Cloud Firestore (NoSQL Database for user data, reports, bookings, chat)
    * Firebase Storage (File storage for images, chat attachments)
* **Backend (AI Service):** Python (Flask/FastAPI recommended), YOLOv8 (Ultralytics library)
* **Libraries:** jsPDF, html2canvas (for PDF generation)

## üî• Firebase Setup (Required)

This project relies heavily on Firebase. You **must** create your own Firebase project to run it.

1.  **Create Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Enable Services:**
    * **Authentication:** Enable Email/Password sign-in method.
    * **Firestore Database:** Create a Firestore database in **Test mode** initially (for easy setup) or **Production mode** (and configure security rules - see `firestore.rules` in this repo).
    * **Storage:** Enable Firebase Storage.
3.  **Get Config Keys:**
    * In your Firebase project settings (‚öôÔ∏è > Project settings), find the "Web apps" section.
    * Register a new web app (give it any nickname).
    * Copy the `firebaseConfig` object provided. It looks like this:
        ```javascript
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
          measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // Optional
        };
        ```
4.  **Add Keys to Code:** Paste **your own** `firebaseConfig` object into each of the HTML files (`index.html`, `dashboard.html`, `doctor.html`, `admin.html`, `login.html`, etc.) where you see the placeholder `firebaseConfig`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the MAMMOCARE web application locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mammocare-repo.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mammocare-repo.git)
    cd mammocare-repo
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/mammocare-repo.git` with your actual repository URL)*

2.  **Firebase Configuration:** Complete the **Firebase Setup** steps above and add your unique `firebaseConfig` keys to all relevant HTML files.

3.  **Set Up AI Backend:**
    * This project requires a separate Python server running the YOLOv8 model for detections. The code for this server is likely in a different repository or folder.
    * Follow the setup instructions for that AI backend server (install Python dependencies like `ultralytics`, `fastapi`/`flask`, `uvicorn`, `python-multipart`, `cors`).
    * **Important:** Start the Python AI server. Note the URL it's running on (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict`).

4.  **Configure AI Backend URL:**
    * You need to tell the web app where to find the AI server.
    * Log in to the MAMMOCARE application as an **Admin** user (you might need to create one manually in Firebase Authentication and Firestore initially, setting the `role` to `admin` in Firestore).
    * Go to the **System Settings** page in the Admin portal.
    * Enter the correct URL of your running AI server (from step 3) into the **"Detection Backend URL"** field and save. This saves the URL to Firestore.

5.  **Run the Frontend:**
    * This project uses plain HTML, CSS, and JS files. You can typically open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
    * Alternatively, if you are using a simple development server (like VS Code's Live Server extension or Python's `http.server`), start it in the project directory.
    ```bash
    # Example using Python's simple server (run from the project root folder)
    python -m http.server
    ```
    * Open your browser to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). *(Note: If your Python server uses port 8000, use a different port for the frontend, e.g., `python -m http.server 8080`)*.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  Make sure your **Python AI Backend server** is running.
2.  Make sure your **Frontend** is accessible (either via file opening or a local server).
3.  Navigate to the main page (`index.html` or your local server address).
4.  **Guest:** Use the "Upload & Detect" feature directly.
5.  **Patient/Doctor/Admin:** Use the "Login/Sign Up" buttons to access the respective portals (`login.html`, `dashboard.html`, `doctor.html`, `admin.html`). You may need to create accounts first via the Sign Up page or directly in Firebase. Ensure users have the correct `role` ('patient', 'doctor', 'admin') set in their Firestore document under the `/users/{userId}` path.
